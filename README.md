# elmChallenges

This is a learning project that aims to help me better understand Elm programming language.
The challenges are provided by Gil Mizrahi. 

## Challenge No. 1

Create a program that does the following:

The program will print "Right" in the middle of the screen if the mouse cursor is on the right half of the screen or will print "Left" instead in middle of the screen if the mouse cursor in on the left half of the screen. Try to add different background and foreground colors as well :) also, resizing the browser window should not break the application.

## Challenge No. 2 

Write a program that fills the screen with small blue circles, produced (pseudo) randomly and over time (choose how much time to wait between generating a new circle).

## Challenge No. 3 

add two new abilities:
 
- when the 'P' key on the keyboard is pressed, pause the generation of new circles and when pressed again, resume.
- when the 'R' key on the keyboard is pressed, reset and start the animation from the beginning.

extra: try to add two buttons which will do the same 'P' and 'R' do.
